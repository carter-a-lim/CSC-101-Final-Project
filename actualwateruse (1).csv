ACWD’s RES LAM data provided by the Department included parcels and vegetated areas served by ACWD multifamily DIMs. In future reporting years, ACWD will determine the total number of meters included and their annual consumption.  The consumption from multifamily DIMs are reported under Multifamily Residential (not CII DIM) in the SAFER Clearinghouse. Therefore, both the square footage and the consumption for multifamily DIMs are being captured under the Residential Outdoor Standard. In future reporting years, ACWD will determine what areas are SLAs and if landscape areas served by multifamily DIMs would be better accounted for under the CII DIM Standard."

Once constructed, these facilities will have a DIM for recycled water irrigation installed and have their area measured as a Special Landscape Area. There are currently two accounts that use well water for landscape irrigation. Cell B24: City of Healdsburg provides recycled water for agricultural irrigation (predominately vineyards) in the surrounding area outside of its service territory. In Fiscal Year 23 24, 88,722,154 gallons of recycled water was supplied to vineyards located outside the service territory, offsetting private groundwater well use. As of January 2024 and in future reporting years, this recycled water will not be included in the nonpotable deliveries numbers above in cell B21. (For July to December 2023, this usage was included in the reported numbers that are being used to auto populate and made up 68.7 million gallons of the usage shown in cell B21.)

The number provided reflects the DIM consumption for accounts classified as Residential in the City's billing system. As City staff continue to work on the commercial landscape areas, the initial LAM analysis fields may also be analyzed and updated as appliable in future reports. The selection of “No” in cells B35 and B39 is a placeholder until this analysis can be completed, and does not represent the final review of the LAM data."

We believe this number is actually larger, as our GIS coordinator estimated that roughly 13,000 accounts had landscape that was not included in DWR's LAM analysis. While the majority of the 13,000+ accounts did not have right of way parcels included, there are also a number of accounts that have landscape that were not included but are beyond just right of way parcels. Thus, we believe the number we provided is a conservation estimate. District staff will be working to provide more updated, accurate GIS information in lieu of the DWR provided LAM analysis in 2025."

This measurement is currently being finalized and will be included in a future Alternative Data submittal. A39/40: Residential landscapes with DIMs, that are not single family homes, are interpreted to be landscape area of apartments and homeowner associations irrigated by dedicated irrigation meters.

This assumption was made based off of prior analysis of average water indoor/outdoor usage at single family parcels with one meter. This value does not include residential DIM not captured by the DWR LAM analysis because this water usage is accounted for under actual CII DIM consumption. Row 38 (cell B38)   This volume of water is accounted for within the CII Dedication Irrigation Meter actual usage. Row 40 (cell B40)   There are two water accounts that the City classifies as CII that were included in the residential DWR LAM, however only the water associated with one of those accounts is provided here because the second is part of a larger parcel which was only partially included in the LAM and therefore difficult to account for water usage in which landscape area."

Therefore, SMWD's data shows that the State's residential landscape area measurements incorrectly categorize a significant amount of CII DIM landscape area. Similarly, some parcels with DIMs were classified by the State as residential landscapes when they are actually CII landscapes. For these reasons, SMWD entered ""YES"" in rows 37 and 39. SMWD also provided, in row 38, a volume of DIM deliveries to residential landscapes. SMWD will wait to report volumes in Row 40  until SMWD is able to report CII DIM deliveries and CII DIM LAM in subsequent reporting periods as alternative supplier data.   In future reports, SMWD intends to submit alternative landscape area data for both Residential and CII DIM parcels, which will help SMWD more accurately calculate the volume of water used in each sector. These calculated water volumes may differ from what is recorded in the SAFER and eAR reports since this Conservation Framework defines water user categories and sums up consumption differently than SAFER or the eAR.   Moving forward, SMWD proposes working on a method that enables retailers to correct water use volumes they know are delivered to specific customer and landscape types."
